Outline of algorithm:

Read in modules, assign index to each modules
Read in module rules, inputted as a set two integers separated by a space per line. 
    Rules read in stored as a hashset For every index, (Direction, PossibleModule)

NxM array that stores all potential module rules
    Each array cell stores a single hashset

Rules file formatted as follows:
    Number of modules
    A_NorthPossible1 A_NorthPossible2 ...
    A_EastPossible1 A_EastPossible2 ...
    A_SouthPossible1 A_SouthPossible2 ...
    A_WestPossible1 A_WestPossible2 ...
    B_NorthPossible1 B_NorthPossible2 ...
    ...


TODO: 
Function that reads in rules as a txt file
